Well, I ain't Burt Reynolds
And I ain't Tom Selleck
I got bills up the pike
And my car's an old relic

I get Chevrolet pay
But I've got a big smile
'Cause my little baby loves me
Cadillac style

Well, I don't have a condo
In Panama City
And you could say I'm a member
Of the poor boy committee

But I kinda feel rich
When I've been with her awhile
'Cause my little baby loves me
Cadillac style

Well, about 10:30
Lord, she puts me in drive
Turns all the lights down
And man, alive!

All eight cylinders a-firin' in line
I'm never out of gas
And I'm always on time

Well, I ain't Goldfinger
And I ain't Joe Fashion
And you can't buy much
With the checks I'm cashin'

So, people if you wonder why
I'm a-ridin' with a smile
It's 'cause my little baby loves me
Cadillac Style

Well, about 10:30
Lord, she puts me in drive
Turns all the lights down
And man, alive!

All eight cylinders a-firin' in line
I'm never out of gas
And I'm always on time

Well, I ain't Goldfinger
And I ain't Joe Fashion
And you can't buy much
With the checks I'm cashin'

So, people, if you wonder why
I'm a-ridin' with a smile
It's 'cause my little baby loves me
Cadillac style

Yeah, my little baby loves me
Cadillac Style
Well, my little baby loves me
Cadillac style
